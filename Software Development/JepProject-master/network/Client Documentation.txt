JEOPARDY CLIENT INTERFACE DOC---
once you make an instance of JepClient, you must make a new Thread and set it as the Thread's target:
    JepClient network=new JepClient();
    Thread netWorker=new Thread(network);
Then you can start the thread to do begin periodic communication with the server:
            netWorker.start();
This updates various things periodically, like player names and scores.
Additionally, you can simply call the following methods directly from an instance of JepClient:
    
    boolean setIpAddress(String address);
        -changes the server's ip address to any given String.
        -automatically determines if the address String is valid or not.
        -returns true if the address is changed successfully, false otherwise.

    boolean setName(String name);
        -sets the name of the current player to name.
        -returns true if successful, or false if name is blank, only spaces, or null.
        -syncs with the server to update the new name for all players

    boolean attemptQuestion(int row, int column);
        -tells the server (and therefore quizmaster) which question is being attempted by a player.
        -returns true if received and false otherwise.
        -in order to find out if the verbal answer is correct, the player's code must periodically check for changes in scores using getScores();
        -ideally, JepClient should not be responsible for determining if a question has already been attempted since that check can be performed by the GUI's ActionListener.

    boolean quitGame();
        -tells the server to leave the current game.
        -should really only be called before the game actually starts, since new players should not be allowed to join mid-game.
        -returns true if the server got the request, false otherwise

    boolean joinGame();
        -attempts to join the game given the currently set server ip address.
        -if successful, the internal playerNumber is set to a value from 0-2,
        and returns true. Returns false otherwise, and playerNumber remains the initial value of -1.
        -only lets a given ip address connect to the server once (so no duplicate players).

    int[] getScores();
        -returns an int[3] containing the current scores of the game's players.
        -the score of any given player is located at getScores()[playerNumber-1].
        -for finding the names of the players, see getNames();

    String[] getNames();
        -returns a String[3] containing the current names of the game's players.
        -the name of any given player is located at getNames()[playerNumber-1].
        -for finding the scores of the players, see getScores();

    String[][] getBoard();
        -a network-expensive way of getting the question board to be used for a new game.
        -returns a String[][] containing the next question board.
        -getBoard()[0][] contains Strings of the categories, while every other element is a question.
        -should only be called at the start of new games.

*Important note: you must call setIpAddress() successfully in order call any of the other methods.
Otherwise, bad things will happen (none of them will crash, but they might return some null values).

**Importanter note: clients are not allowed to update their scores, only the server is able to.
They can change their names at will, however. This is to prevent high-level hacks from cheaters looking to make millions of points.
Probably not likely, but it's good form.

***Importantest note: The server is set up to only allow one client per ip address, meaning I can't actually
debug the methods that require three players. Stupid, I know, but there's no quick workaround for it.
